# MySQL Action


Description
-----------
Action that runs a MySQL command.

-------
Suppose you want to execute a query against a MySQL database named "prod" that is running on "localhost" 
port 3306 (Ensure that the driver for MySQL is installed. You can also provide driver name for some specific driver, 
otherwise "mysql" will be used), then configure the plugin with:

```
Driver Name: "mysql"
Database Command: "UPDATE table_name SET price = 20 WHERE ID = 6"
Host: "localhost"
Port: 3306
Database: "prod"
```
