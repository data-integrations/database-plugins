@Mssql
Feature: Mssql - Verify Mssql source data transfer
  @MSSQL_SOURCE_DATATYPES_TEST3 @MSSQL_SINK_TEST @Mssql_Required
  Scenario: To verify data is getting transferred from Mssql to Mssql successfully
    Given Open Datafusion Project to configure pipeline
    When Expand Plugin group in the LHS plugins list: "Source"
    When Select plugin: "SQL Server" from the plugins list as: "Source"
    When Expand Plugin group in the LHS plugins list: "Sink"
    When Select plugin: "SQL Server" from the plugins list as: "Sink"
    Then Connect plugins: "SQL Server" and "SQL Server2" to establish connection
    Then Navigate to the properties page of plugin: "SQL Server"
    Then Select dropdown plugin property: "select-jdbcPluginName" with option value: "driverName"
    Then Replace input plugin property: "host" with value: "host" for Credentials and Authorization related fields
    Then Replace input plugin property: "port" with value: "port" for Credentials and Authorization related fields
    Then Replace input plugin property: "user" with value: "username" for Credentials and Authorization related fields
    Then Replace input plugin property: "password" with value: "password" for Credentials and Authorization related fields
    Then Enter input plugin property: "referenceName" with value: "sourceRef"
    Then Replace input plugin property: "database" with value: "databaseName"
    Then Enter textarea plugin property: "importQuery" with value: "selectQuery"
    Then Click on the Get Schema button
    Then Verify the Output Schema matches the Expected Schema: "outputDatatypesSchema3"
    Then Validate "SQL Server" plugin properties
    Then Close the Plugin Properties page
    Then Navigate to the properties page of plugin: "SQL Server2"
    Then Select dropdown plugin property: "select-jdbcPluginName" with option value: "driverName"
    Then Replace input plugin property: "host" with value: "host" for Credentials and Authorization related fields
    Then Replace input plugin property: "port" with value: "port" for Credentials and Authorization related fields
    Then Replace input plugin property: "database" with value: "databaseName"
    Then Replace input plugin property: "tableName" with value: "targetTable"
    Then Replace input plugin property: "dbSchemaName" with value: "schema"
    Then Replace input plugin property: "user" with value: "username" for Credentials and Authorization related fields
    Then Replace input plugin property: "password" with value: "password" for Credentials and Authorization related fields
    Then Enter input plugin property: "referenceName" with value: "targetRef"
    Then Validate "SQL Server2" plugin properties
    Then Close the Plugin Properties page
    Then Save the pipeline
    Then Preview and run the pipeline
    Then Verify the preview of pipeline is "success"
    Then Click on preview data for Mssql sink
    Then Verify preview output schema matches the outputSchema captured in properties
    Then Close the preview data
    Then Deploy the pipeline
    Then Run the Pipeline in Runtime
    Then Wait till pipeline is in running state
    Then Open and capture logs
    Then Verify the pipeline status is "Succeeded"
    Then Validate records transferred to target table are equal to number of records from the source table
